Incident Report: Holodeck 3, Deck 11

## Executive Summary

A recursive rendering loop in the holographic projection matrix resulted in a 127-hour debugging session. The safety protocols had been overridden by what appeared to be a rogue semicolon.

## Timeline of Events

**Hour 0**: Ensign Kim initiates "Jazz Club, New Orleans, 1958" program.

**Hour 3**: First anomaly detected. The saxophone player begins reciting ship's diagnostic codes.

**Hour 17**: Walls of the jazz club begin displaying React error boundaries.

**Hour 48**: Chief Engineer dispatched. Discovers the holodeck is running Node.js 0.12.

**Hour 89**: Attempted npm install causes temporal paradox.

**Hour 127**: Resolution achieved by turning it off and on again.

## Root Cause Analysis

The holodeck's pattern buffers were still using CommonJS modules while the matter conversion subsystem had been upgraded to ES Modules. The impedance mismatch created a quantum superposition where both states existed simultaneously.

## Corrective Actions

1. Standardize on ES Modules across all ship systems
2. Implement circuit breakers for recursive rendering
3. Add `"use strict"` to all holographic subroutines
4. Never let Ensign Kim touch the holodeck alone

## Lessons Learned

Sometimes the bug is not in the code. Sometimes the bug is that you're questioning the nature of your reality while a holographic trumpet player judges your debugging skills.
